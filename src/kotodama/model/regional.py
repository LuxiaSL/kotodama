"""Regional compile of the decode forwards: one compiled graph per layer signature instead of one graph of the whole
depth.

The whole-step compile traces every effective layer into one graph, so its compile time grows with depth and every
bucket width (rows, or block tokens) compiles the whole depth again. A layer's code is the same at every depth; what
differs between layers is only static structure: how many committed AttnRes sources its routing reads, whether it
opens a block, whether its MLP input is captured and whether it signs (kotodama.model.signing). The regional path compiles one graph per such signature, with
every weight, norm gain, routing query, KV buffer and lever row passed in as a tensor (no module attribute is read
inside a region, so nothing guards on which layer's module it is), and runs the depth loop in Python. Every caller's
signatures get code objects of their own, so each code object holds one compiled graph and dynamo's per-code-object
recompile limit stays out of reach however many signatures and widths a server builds.

The regions run without CUDA graphs; on a CUDA engine the caller captures its whole forward (embedding, depth loop,
tail, sampler) as one CUDA graph (``StepGraph``), so a replay stays launch-free.

Used by kotodama.model.multi_decode (the row decoders) and kotodama.model.decode_engine (the single-stream step and
block forward).
